# Anatomy Group Preference Survey (Sample)

## Anatomy Group Preference Survey

**Note:** This is a sample. In an actual survey, personal identification will be verified using the university's authentication system, and email addresses will be collected.

**Response Deadline:** 9:00 a.m. on the first Monday of August

Starting in September, anatomy classes will begin. A significant portion of the course involves anatomy dissection sessions, and students will be divided into groups of four. Since you’ll be spending a lot of time with your group until December, group selection is important. To "automatically optimize group formation using a computer," we are collecting preferences from each student.

Please note that while this survey includes personal information, only those in charge of group assignments will handle the data. The data will be processed by a dedicated program to determine groupings. This information will not affect your grades. After processing, the raw data will be discarded and will not be used for any other purpose (*).

*To improve the program, anonymized data with names and student numbers replaced by random values may be used. Additionally, anonymous statistical data may be used for program improvement or academic presentations.*

No inquiries regarding your responses will be answered (even by you).

## Section 3 of 5: How to Enter Preferences

For each student, imagine participating in the anatomy dissection sessions together, and rate how “good” it would be for you on a scale of 1 to 5.

| Rating | Description   |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 5      | Good          |
| 4      | Somewhat good |
| 3      | Neutral       |
| 2      | Somewhat bad  |
| 1      | Bad           |

The "goodness" refers to whether you feel you can comfortably work together and improve your performance. This may not necessarily match how friendly you are with the person. Rather than evaluating the other person, think about how your relationship with them affects your own performance.

## Section 4 of 5: Important Notes

If you give extreme ratings of 1 or 2 to everyone except those you prefer, it may result in suboptimal or even unworkable group assignments.

Please ensure that the combined total of 1’s and 2’s is no more than 10% of your ratings.

If this limit is exceeded, 1’s and 2’s will be automatically replaced with 3’s.

On smartphones, some options may be cut off at the right edge. If this happens, switch to landscape mode or swipe left to view the options.
