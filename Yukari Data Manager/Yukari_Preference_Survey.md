# Yukari Peer Preference Survey (sample)

The following survey is implemented on a secure Google Form and is intended for all anatomy students.

---

**Deadline**: the first Monday of the coming August

Your anatomy class starts this September. You will participate in anatomy dissection in a team of four for three months, so your success in this course largely depends on the team assignment. We, the anatomy faculty, use a computer-optimization system to assign teams based on your personal preferences collected through this secure survey.

Given the sensitivity of the information, only one faculty member, bound by confidentiality, will handle the data. The collected information will be used exclusively for team assignments and will not be disclosed to any parties, even if an individual requests his or her own data. Your responses to this survey will not affect your academic scores. (†)

† Anonymized and/or statistical data may be used to improve the assignment program and for scientific reports.

\* Required questions

## Will you respond this survey? *

By choosing “No”, the survey will end without your participation and your team assignment will be done using default options.

- Yes
- No 

## How committed are you to studying anatomy dissection?

Please let us know about your level of commitment to anatomy. Be honest—don't exaggerate or downplay your dedication. Choose the single option that best describes you.

### Motivation for Anatomy Dissection \*

How much do you agree with the following statement? – "I am looking forward to anatomy dissection and am willing to do my best."

- 5 = Agree
- 4 = Somewhat agree
- 3 = Neither agree nor disagree
- 2 = Somewhat disagree
- 1 = Disagree

### Time available for anatomy dissection *

Anatomy dissection can be time-consuming and may extend beyond the scheduled time, sometimes lasting until 8 PM when the dissection room closes. How late are you willing to work on dissection?

- 5 = I don’t mind staying late (past 8:00 PM)
- 4 = I don’t mind staying a bit late (about 1.5 hours after the scheduled time)
- 3 = I would prefer to finish on time (about 30 minutes past the scheduled time)
- 2 = I would prefer to finish slightly early (about 45 minutes before the scheduled time)
- 1 = I would prefer to finish significantly earlier (about 1.5 hours before the scheduled time)

## How do you evaluate your preference for each classmate?

Indicate how favorable it would be for you to be assigned to the same anatomy team as the classmate in question. Consider how much this teammate would enhance your academic performance, not necessarily how much you personally like the person.

- 5 = Good
- 4 = Somewhat good
- 3 = Neither good nor bad
- 2 = Somewhat bad
- 1 = Bad

**Note:** An excessively biased response, such as choosing “5” for a few friends and “1” for all others, may make computer optimization difficult or even infeasible for the entire class. Please choose “1” or “2” for 10% or fewer of your classmates. If your selections of “1” or “2” exceed 10%, all of those responses will be replaced with “3.”

### Your peer preferences

Choose one option per line. If you do not make a selection, the default value will be set to "3".
